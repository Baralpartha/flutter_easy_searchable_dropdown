## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The `FlutterEasySearchableDropdown` widget provides a **single-selection dropdown** with:

* Searchable input field
* Clearable selection
* Fully customizable UI (text style, icons, hints)
* Smooth overlay dropdown list

Users can type in the search field to filter options dynamically.
Selecting an item updates the input and triggers the `onChanged` callback.
